# AMS HR Retention Analytics Project

## Project Summary

This project will support **Alpha Manufacturing Solutions (AMS)** in improving employee retention through predictive analytics, SAP data integration, and interactive dashboard development.  
Our consulting team will use an agile approach to design, build, and deliver a scalable HR analytics solution that identifies key drivers of turnover and provides real-time insights for decision-making.

The solution will combine **SAP ERP HR data**, **payroll information**, and **employee survey results** into an integrated dataset for modeling and visualization. Predictive analytics will be used to forecast attrition risk across departments and demographic groups.  
Outputs will be delivered through both a **Power BI dashboard** and a **Streamlit web application**, giving AMS executives and HR staff easy access to insights and simulations.

## Project Phases (Epics)

### Discovery and Planning
We will define project goals, retention metrics, and success criteria with AMS leadership.  
Data sources, access permissions, and compliance requirements will be confirmed.

### Data Integration and Modeling
We will consolidate HR data from SAP and other systems, clean and validate it, and develop predictive models to estimate turnover risk.  
This phase will also include benchmarking retention metrics and identifying top attrition drivers.

### Dashboard Development
We will design and deploy two visualization tools:  
- A **Power BI dashboard** for executives to monitor company-wide retention metrics.  
- A **Streamlit app** for HR analysts to explore risk factors interactively and run “what-if” scenarios.

### Testing and Refinement
We will test data accuracy, model performance, and dashboard functionality through validation sprints and user acceptance testing.  
Feedback from AMS HR stakeholders will guide improvements.

### Training and Handover
We will create documentation, record walkthroughs, and conduct training sessions so AMS staff can maintain and update the dashboards independently.

## Agile Approach

Work will be completed in two-week sprints using Scrum principles.  
Each sprint will include sprint planning, daily standups, reviews, and retrospectives to ensure transparency and adaptability.  
GitHub Issues and the Project Board will be used to track user stories and epics across To Do, In Progress, and Done columns.

## Anticipated Challenges

- **Data Security:** Protecting sensitive HR and employee data through anonymization and secure credentials.  
- **System Integration:** Aligning SAP data with external datasets while maintaining data quality.  
- **Model Interpretability:** Balancing statistical accuracy with results that HR leaders can easily understand.  
- **Streamlit Deployment:** Ensuring secure hosting, fast load times, and user-friendly navigation.

Agile’s iterative structure will help manage these challenges through regular feedback, short development cycles, and early testing.
